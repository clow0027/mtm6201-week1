<!-- NOTES -->
<!-- BRANCHES: Use branches when you want to add features without disrupting the live website. Use a branch to implement the new feature, check if it works, then merge the branches. If you're working with someone, you want to be working on different branches.-->

<!-- GITHUB - Issues: Think of it like milestones. You're going to get x step done by x date, then you can add yourself to the issue so you know it's your responsibility. Also if you're having an actual issue (trouble) you can ask a collaborator for help. -->
